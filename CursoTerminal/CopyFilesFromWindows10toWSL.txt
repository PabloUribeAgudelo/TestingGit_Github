- There are two methods mentioned in this website.

- I prefer method 2, so will be summarising this method only.

- Open your linux distribution, in my case, it is Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

- I find my file in the following path:

cd /mnt/c/Users/<username>/Desktop - /mnt/c is the Windows' C Drive mounted to Linux.

- Then copy the file into my WSL's home directory:

cp <filename> ~/

- Now go to the WSL's home directory and you can find the file there.

cd ~/
